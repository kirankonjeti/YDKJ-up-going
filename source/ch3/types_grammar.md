## Types & Grammar

The third title in this series primarily focuses on tackling yet another highly controversial topic: type coercion. Perhaps no topic causes more frustration with JS developers than when you talk about the confusions surrounding implicit coercion.

By far, the conventional wisdom is that implicit coercion is a "bad part" of the language and should be avoided at all costs. In fact, some have gone so far as to call it a "flaw" in the design of the language. Indeed, there are tools whose entire job is to do nothing but scan your code and complain if you're doing anything even remotely like coercion.

But is coercion really so confusing, so bad, so treacherous, that your code is doomed from the start if you use it?

I say no. After having built up an understanding of how types and values really work in Chapters 1-3, Chapter 4 takes on this debate and fully explains how coercion works, in all its nooks and crevices. We see just what parts of coercion really are surprising and what parts actually make complete sense if given the time to learn.

But I'm not merely suggesting that coercion is sensible and learnable, I'm asserting that coercion is an incredibly useful and totally underestimated tool that *you should be using in your code.* I'm saying that coercion, when used properly, not only works, but makes your code better. All the naysayers and doubters will surely scoff at such a position, but I believe it's one of the main keys to upping your JS game.

Do you want to just keep following what the crowd says, or are you willing to set all the assumptions aside and look at coercion with a fresh perspective? The *Types & Grammar* title of this series will coerce your thinking.
