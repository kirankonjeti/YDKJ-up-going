## Async & Performance

The first three titles of this series focus on the core mechanics of the language, but the fourth title branches out slightly to cover patterns on top of the language mechanics for managing asynchronous programming. Asynchrony is not only critical to the performance of our applications, it's increasingly becoming *the* critical factor in writability and maintainability.

The book starts first by clearing up a lot of terminology and concept confusion around things like "async," "parallel," and "concurrent," and explains in depth how such things do and do not apply to JS.

Then we move into examining callbacks as the primary method of enabling asynchrony. But it's here that we quickly see that the callback alone is hopelessly insufficient for the modern demands of asynchronous programming. We identify two major deficiencies of callbacks-only coding: *Inversion of Control* (IoC) trust loss and lack of linear reason-ability.

To address these two major deficiencies, ES6 introduces two new mechanisms (and indeed, patterns): promises and generators.

Promises are a time-independent wrapper around a "future value," which lets you reason about and compose them regardless of if the value is ready or not yet. Moreover, they effectively solve the IoC trust issues by routing callbacks through a trustable and composable promise mechanism.

Generators introduce a new mode of execution for JS functions, whereby the generator can be paused at `yield` points and be resumed asynchronously later. The pause-and-resume capability enables synchronous, sequential looking code in the generator to be processed asynchronously behind the scenes. By doing so, we address the non-linear, non-local-jump confusions of callbacks and thereby make our asynchronous code sync-looking so as to be more reason-able.

But it's the combination of promises and generators that "yields" our most effective asynchronous coding pattern to date in JavaScript. In fact, much of the future sophistication of asynchrony coming in ES7 and later will certainly be built on this foundation. To be serious about programming effectively in an async world, you're going to need to get really comfortable with combining promises and generators.

If promises and generators are about expressing patterns that let our programs run more concurrently and thus get more processing accomplished in a shorter period, JS has many other facets of performance optimization worth exploring.

Chapter 5 delves into topics like program parallelism with Web Workers and data parallelism with SIMD, as well as low-level optimization techniques like ASM.js. Chapter 6 takes a look at performance optimization from the perspective of proper benchmarking techniques, including what kinds of performance to worry about and what to ignore.

Writing JavaScript effectively means writing code that can break the constraint barriers of being run dynamically in a wide range of browsers and other environments. It requires a lot of intricate and detailed planning and effort on our parts to take a program from "it works" to "it works well."

The *Async & Performance* title is designed to give you all the tools and skills you need to write reasonable and performant JavaScript code.
