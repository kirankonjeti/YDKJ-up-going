## Conditionals

"Do you want to add on the extra screen protectors to your purchase, for $9.99?" The helpful phone store employee has asked you to make a decision. And you may need to first consult the current *state* of your wallet or bank account to answer that question. But obviously, this is just a simple "yes or no" question.

There are quite a few ways we can express *conditionals* (aka decisions) in our programs.

The most common one is the `if` statement. Essentially, you're saying, "*If* this condition is true, do the following...". For example:

```js
var bank_balance = 302.13;
var amount = 99.99;

if (amount < bank_balance) {
	console.log( "I want to buy this phone!" );
}
```

The `if` statement requires an expression in between the parentheses `( )` that can be treated as either `true` or `false`. In this program, we provided the expression `amount < bank_balance`, which indeed will either evaluate to `true` or `false` depending on the amount in the `bank_balance` variable.

You can even provide an alternative if the condition isn't true, called an `else` clause. Consider:

```js
const ACCESSORY_PRICE = 9.99;

var bank_balance = 302.13;
var amount = 99.99;

amount = amount * 2;

// can we afford the extra purchase?
if ( amount < bank_balance ) {
	console.log( "I'll take the accessory!" );
	amount = amount + ACCESSORY_PRICE;
}
// otherwise:
else {
	console.log( "No, thanks." );
}
```

Here, if `amount < bank_balance` is `true`, we'll print out `"I'll take the accessory!"` and add the `9.99` to our `amount` variable. Otherwise, the `else` clause says we'll just politely respond with `"No, thanks."` and leave `amount` unchanged.

As we discussed in "Values & Types" earlier, values that aren't already of an expected type are often coerced to that type. The `if` statement expects a `boolean`, but if you pass it something that's not already `boolean`, coercion will occur.

JavaScript defines a list of specific values that are considered "falsy" because when coerced to a `boolean`, they become `false` -- these include values like `0` and `""`. Any other value not on the "falsy" list is automatically "truthy" -- when coerced to a `boolean` they become `true`. Truthy values include things like `99.99` and `"free"`. See "Truthy & Falsy" in Chapter 2 for more information.

*Conditionals* exist in other forms besides the `if`. For example, the `switch` statement can be used as a shorthand for a series of `if..else` statements (see Chapter 2). Loops (see "Loops") use a *conditional* to determine if the loop should keep going or stop.

**Note:** For deeper information about the coercions that can occur implicitly in the test expressions of *conditionals*, see Chapter 4 of the *Types & Grammar* title of this series.
